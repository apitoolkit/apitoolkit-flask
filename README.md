# API Toolkit Python Flask SDK

The API Toolkit Flask client is an sdk used to integrate flask web services with APIToolkit.
It monitors incoming traffic, gathers the requests and sends the request to the apitoolkit servers.

## Design decisions:

- Use the gcp SDK to send real time traffic from REST APIs to the gcp topic

## How to Integrate:

First install the apitoolkit flask sdk:
`pip install apitoolkit-flask`

Then add apitoolkit to your app like so (flask example):

```python
from flask import Flask
from apitoolkit_flask import APIToolkit

app = Flask(__name__)

apitoolkit = APIToolkit(api_key="<API_KEY>", debug=True)


@app.before_request
def before_request():
    apitoolkit.beforeRequest()

@app.after_request
def after_request(response):
    apitoolkit.afterRequest(response)
    return response


@app.route('/hello', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def sample_route(subject):
    return {"Hello": "World"}

app.run(debug=True)

```

This will monitor all requests and send them to the APIToolkit's servers.

## Client Redacting fields

While it's possible to mark a field as redacted from the apitoolkit dashboard, this client also supports redacting at the client side.
Client side redacting means that those fields would never leave your servers at all. So you feel safer that your sensitive data only stays on your servers.

To mark fields that should be redacted, add them to the APIToolkit constructor.
Eg:

```python
from flask import Flask
from apitoolkit_flask import APIToolkit

app = Flask(__name__)

# A list of fields to redact from response body
redact_res = ["$.api_key", "$.password"]
# A list of fields to redact from request body
redact_req = ["$.credit-card.cvv", "$.credit-card.name"]
# A list of fields to redact from request and repsonse headers
redact_headers = ["Authorization", "Cookie"]

apitoolkit = APIToolkit(api_key="<API_KEY>", debug=True,redact_response_body=redact_res, redact_request_body=redact_req,redact_headers=redact_headers)

@app.before_request
def before_request():
    apitoolkit.beforeRequest()

@app.after_request
def after_request(response):
    apitoolkit.afterRequest(response)
    return response


@app.route('/hello', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def sample_route(subject):
    return {"Hello": "World"}

app.run(debug=True)
```

It is important to note that while the `redact_headers` config field accepts a list of headers(case insensitive),
the `redact_request_body` and `redact_response_body` expect a list of JSONPath strings as arguments.

The choice of JSONPath was selected to allow you have great flexibility in descibing which fields within your responses are sensitive.
Also note that these list of items to be redacted will be aplied to all endpoint requests and responses on your server.
